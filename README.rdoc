= SimRedis (Pure Ruby Redis simulator for redis-rb)

* http://github.com/peterc/simredis

== STATUS:

SimRedis is NOT READY FOR ANY SORT OF SERIOUS USE YET! Currently all of the generic and string methods are working OK, except for anything involving expiration or blocking.

== DESCRIPTION:

SimRedis is a Redis simulator for the popular redis-rb library. SimRedis lets you use the Redis Ruby client library without a Redis daemon running. Everything is stored in memory only and is very thread unsafe, but persistence and locking comes in time.

Why simulate Redis? I love Redis and some of the ideas it brings to the table, and while I can roll out onto servers stocked with working Redis installs OK, sometimes I might want to still use Redis in my app but not require its full power (or I might want to deploy somewhere that doesn't have Redis - like Dreamhost, say). I'd also like to distribute apps I make so that other people can use them without being forced to install a whole new daemon first.

== EXAMPLES:

  require 'redis'
  require 'simredis'
  
  r = Redis.new
  r.set("a", "hello world")
  r.get("a")  # => "hello world"
  r.keys("*") # => ['a']
  r.flushdb
  r.keys("*") # => []
    
SimRedis comes with tests (of a sort) "baked in." Running the simredis.rb file directly runs the suite.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile, version, or history as it's handled by Jeweler (which is awesome, btw).
* Send me a pull request. I may or may not accept it (sorry, practicality rules.. but message me and we can talk!)
